  utter_greet:
    - text: "Hey! Iam a corona bot"

  utter_corona:
    - text:
        "Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
        in animals or humans.coronaviruses are known
        to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
        severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
        and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)."

  utter_covid-19:
    - text: "It is the new virus and infectious disease which is unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan,china,in DEC 2019"

  utter_symptoms_of_corona:
    - text: "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
        dry cough .Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
        congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea."

  utter_covid19_spread:
    - text: "The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales"

  utter_covid19_spread_no_symptoms:
    - text:
        "The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
        people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms."

  utter_covid19_spread_from_feces:
    - text: "The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
        appears to be low. The ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
        this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
        after using the bathroom and before eating"

  utter_covid19_prevention:
    - text: "1.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
        2.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
        anyone who is coughing or sneezing
        3.Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol- based
        hand rub or wash them with soap and water
        4.Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
        difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance
        5.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
        respiratory hygiene"

  utter_catching_covid:
    - text: "The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
        there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there."

  utter_worrying_covid:
    - text: "Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
        children and young adults.. It is therefore quite
        normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will
        affect them and their loved ones."

  utter_severe_illness:
    - text: "persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such
        as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or
        diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others"

  utter_antibiotics:
    - text: "No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial
            infections"

  utter_medicines:
    - text: "While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide
        comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence
        that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease."

  utter_SARS:
    - text: "No.SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19.
        There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since
        2003."

  utter_mask: 
    - text: "Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
            coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19."

  utter_mask_usage:
    - text: "1.Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based
            hand rub or soap and water
            2.Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
            3.Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is)
            4.Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the
            coloured side)
            5.Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your
            chin.
            6.After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind
            the ears
            7.. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use"
  
  utter_incubation_period:
    - text: "Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most
            commonly around five day"

  utter_spread_from_animal:
    - text: "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in
            animals .Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses ."
  
  utter_virus_on_surface:
    - text: "Studies suggest that corona viruses  may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
            several days"

  utter_donts:
    - text: "The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and
            can be harmful:
